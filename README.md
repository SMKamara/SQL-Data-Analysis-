# SQL Data Analysis 👩🏾‍💻
In this project, I was tasked with using **SQL queries** to analyze a large dataset from a digital music store 🎼🎚️🎧. 
I successfully analyzed the dataset by using SQL to _clean, analyze, join, filter_ and other aggregations in order to make 
recommendations for optimal business practices. I have attached the _txt_ file of the **SQL queries** I created as well as, 
the data visualizations that provide insights to my findings.
